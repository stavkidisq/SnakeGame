# SnakeGame - Game: "Snake".
<br>
This game is based on the fact that the player controls a character (a snake), on a field fenced with walls. Objects called apples are spawned on it. If the snake eats an apple, its length will increase.
<br>
<br>
Also, the game keeps an account of the apples eaten, for one apple eaten, the player is awarded one point.
<br>
<br>
If the snake's head collides with its tail or with a wall, then the game is over.
